### Homework Questions

1. Did you learn anything new about web development (ie using GitHub, version control, repositories)?
- I learned a lot in this class. I didn't even know where to begin when creating a website from scratch. Repositories are import for the organization and general structure of any website, especially a website with multiple pages and lots of different styling, elements, and attachments. Github is great for beginners and I'm sure there are thousands of people who are of all different levels that use github for web building and collaborative optimization.
2. Did you learn anything new about web design (ie using media, color, fonts)?
- Color in a website is really important especially if your trying to convey a particular feeling that you want people to experience when they see and interact with it. Fonts are the same thing. There are a million different fonts and variations. Choosing the right fonts, generally a combination of a serif and sans serif, is crucial to the style of your website.
3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
- This was probably my favorite assignment thus far because it was all me. I got to take everything I learned this semester and translate it into a website that directly reflects who I am.  I chose to build a personal blog website full off all the things I love to do. I chose colors that lend to how I feel I am as a person, and am starting to create content that I feel like sharing with others. I've always been a fan of journaling and to me this is a way to express that and share some of my favorite experiences, products, and goals.
