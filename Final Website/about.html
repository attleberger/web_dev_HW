        <p>My name is Jami Attleberger. I'm a libra and somtimes I feel like I can be a scorpio as well which makes sense since I was supposed to be born on Halloween.
            I wouldn't say I've had an easy life but I feel blessed to have had the experiences I've had, and I've probably had a lot more in my life than most.
            I lived in California until I was 9 years old, when my parents decided to uproot me and make the trek all the way to Montana. (Yes we were Californians who moved from California to Montana)
            I grew up a small town kid with dreams of doing more than what I could have staying in the small town world. I was lucky enough to be raised by two amazing humans who both served in the military,
            and they are who inspired me to follow their path and become my own person.</br>
            <br><br>
           I spent 4 amazing years serving in the United States Navy as a jet enginge mechanic in the EA-6B Prowlers. Sounds interesting right? I didn't have the most eventful time in the military compared
            to some but it definitely wasn't boring. I served 2 different deployments. The first I spent at Bagram Airforce Base in Afghanistan, and the second I spent in Al'asad Iraq. The military shaped me
            into the person I am today, and I met some of the most incredibly people I couldn't have made it wihtout.</br>
            <br><br>
          After the military I moved home to Montana, and was fortunate enought to move on to the next chapter of my life which I decided was college. If I wouldn't have moved home and attended the University
            of Montana it would have never put me on the path to meet my now husband of almost 3 years. I'm communication major, and naturally I valued human interactions and experiences. Why didn't I choose to be
            an Anthropology major? Who knows. I'm choosing to create and experience for people through my own. I don't know where this blogging journey will take me but I look forward to finding out! Cheers!</p>
