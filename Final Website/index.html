        <h4>Running a 1/2 Marathon</h4>
        <p>At the end of this year I made the decision to challenge myself in 2020 and attempt my first half marathon. Some of you may think i'm crazy, and maybe I am. Not only is this a goal I've always wanted to achieve but it fulfills a lot other needs in my life as well.  Running is something that has taken me to a calm place when I get stressed out. It's time that I get to speak to myself and push myself to reach a goal even if it's just running that extra minute even when my mind is telling me to stop. This is something I've always wanted to experience, and I'm lucky that my best friend and my husband want to experience it with me.  Now this is where my best friend of 15+ years and I differ. She....hates....to run!! I mean really she hates cardio of any kind but she is the one person in my life who motivates me to live a healthier lifestyle, and not for someone else but for myself. So when I told her that I wanted to do this you can imagine how excited I was when she said that no matter where I chose to take my running journey she would be there to cheer me on and hug me at the finish line. I still haven't decided where I'll be running but no matter where I go I know it'll be an experience to remember.</br>
        <br><br>
        Stay tuned for my next post on January 2, 2020! Happy Holidays and I'll see you in the New Year!!!! CHEERS!!!
