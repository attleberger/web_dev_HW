  <h3>Lyrics<h3/>
<pre>
  They say oh my god I see the way you shine
  Take your hand, my dear, and place them both in mine
  You know you stopped me dead when I was passing by
  And now I beg to see you dance just one more time

  Ooh I see you, see you, see you every time
  And oh my I, I like your style
  You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
  And now I beg to see you dance just one more time

  So I say
  Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me oh oh oh
  I've never seen anybody do the things you do before
  They say move for me, move for me, move for me ay ay ay
  And when you're done I'll make you do it all again

  I said oh my god I see you walking by
  Take my hands, my dear, and look me in my eyes
  Just like a monkey I've been dancing my whole life
  And you just beg to see me dance just one more time

  Ooh I see you, see you, see you every time
  And oh my I, I like your style
  You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
  And now I beg to see you dance just one more time

  So I say
  Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me oh oh oh
  I've never seen anybody do the things you do before
  They say move for me, move for me, move for me ay ay ay
  And when you're done I'll make you do it all again

  They say
  Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
  I've never seen anybody do the things you do before
  They say move for me, move for me, move for me ay ay ay
  And when you're done I'll make you do it all again

  Ooh (all again, all again)
  Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh
  Ooh (all again, all again)
  Ah ah, ah ah, ay

  They say
  Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me oh oh oh
  I've never seen anybody do the things you do before
  They say move for me, move for me, move for me ay ay ay
  And when you're done I'll make you do it all again

  They say
  Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
  I've never seen anybody do the things you do before
  They say move for me, move for me, move for me ay ay ay
  And when you're done I'll make you do it all again
  All again
