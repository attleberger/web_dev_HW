### Homework Questions

1. ****Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?
    Something new I got to do on this assignment was to be a little more creative than
    previous assignments. Some old things were the table element, and lists which we have done on previous assignments. It was interesting getting to organize the layout for my instructional process.

2. ****Next module we begin CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?
    I'm anxious to dive further in to designing things more aesthetically. I think i'll enjoy being able to be more intentional about the structure and colors of future assignments with CSS.

3. ****Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
    The first thing I had to do was choose what kind of instruction process I wanted to create on my website. I love to cook so I thought a how to recipe just seemed fitting. I struggled with getting my video element to work on my live site but I finally figured out that I was missing a pesky > sign, and once I figured that out it snapped together. I had to refer back to a previous assignment to get my table to turn out the way that I wanted. Overall I enjoyed this assignment.
