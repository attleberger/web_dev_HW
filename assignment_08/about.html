    <h1>Too Much Chocolate Cake</h1>

    <p>I found this recipe several years ago on allrecipes, which is a phenomenal website with a ton of amazing recipes.
    This cake recipe is my all time favorite, and my number one go to when making cakes, cupcakes, or any variation of either.
    I've even made a vanilla version of this cake subsituting the chocolate pudding and chocolate cake for vanilla flavors.
    I highly recomend this recipe for any sort of get together as it usually doesn't last long and makes enough to go background
    for seconds. Enjoy!</p>
